Enhance your conversational AI experience with my upgraded version of the ChatGPTv3 user client from OpenAI. With a custom API integrated to fetch responses to your queries and store them in a database hosted on Google Firebase, this platform provides a streamlined and efficient solution. I have also added a feature that allows users to select their desired AI model before sending a prompt, providing greater control over the conversational experience.' stack='React, Nextjs, Typescript, TailwindCSS, HTML, Firebase, OpenAI API
