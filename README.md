# ChatGPT+ App Built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Enhance your conversational AI experience with my upgraded version of the ChatGPTv3 user client from OpenAI. With a custom API integrated to fetch responses to your queries and store them in a database hosted on Google Firebase, this platform provides a streamlined and efficient solution. I have also added a feature that allows users to select their desired AI model before sending a prompt, providing greater control over the conversational experience.

## Local Setup
1. clone or fork the repo onto your computer
2. download and install the latest version of node for you Operating System
3. using youre Command Line navigate to the folder where the files are saved
4. run 'npm i' to install all the dependencies
5. next run 'npm run dev' to start the server on localhost:3000


## Coming Soon
- more control over responses by using the api params in the frontend (n,tempature,ect.)
-  user accounts to only see your responses
